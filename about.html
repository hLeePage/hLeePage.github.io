## About
Having grown up before the internet, it took a rather long time for me to discover how much I enjoy coding.
It started a little over a year ago during a conversation with some old friends who started a tech company.
"What if we payed for you to learn iOS development so you could come work for us?"
That sounded good to me!  I began investigating immediately, and although their idea never panned out, I was hooked from the first tutorial.  HTML?
CSS? This is so cool!

After a year of independent study, I signed up for a 12-week "Back-End Engineering" course at The Iron Yard here in Nashville. And now... here I am. Ready to roll.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably making music on something (piano/guitar/drums), working on a foreign language
(Spanish, French, German, Russian), or doing whatever it is my five year old son has instructed me to do, which very likely
has something to do with ninjas.
