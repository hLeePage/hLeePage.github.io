## About
Having grown up before the internet, it took a rather long time for me to discover how much I enjoy coding.  It happened, not that long ago,
with an offer from two old friends who run a tech company: We'll pay for you to learn iOS development so you can come work for us.
Sounded good to me!  I began educating myself immediately, and although their idea panned out, I was hooked from the first tutorial.  HTML?
CSS? This is so cool!

After a year of independent study, I signed up for the 12-week "Back-End Engineering" course at The Iron Yard. And here I am. Ready to roll.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably making music on something (piano/guitar/drums), working on a foreign language
(Spanish, French, German, Russian), or doing whatever it is my five year old son has instructed me to do, which very likely
has something to do with ninjas.
